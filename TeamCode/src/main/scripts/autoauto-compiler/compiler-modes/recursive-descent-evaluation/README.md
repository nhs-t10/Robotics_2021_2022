# Recursive Descent Evaluation

This is the default Compiler Mode. It's safe, consistent, and *easy to build on*. 

This is usually the first Compiler Mode to recieve the latest features.

The design choices *do* sacrifice speed, so if you're looking for blazing-fast auto, go use `human-readable-java` or `autoauto-bytecode`.

## Limitations

*Some* very very esoteric things (e.g. self-modifying code) aren't supported. 

## Additional Functionality

Everything! This is the default mode. It gets features first; it'll have most things before they hit more high-performance compilers.

## When to Use

* When you want it to work
* When you don't need specialised features in other modes.

## When Not to Use

No specific inadvisable uses
