This is a location for one-off tools that I made for one reason or another. They don't help compiling or anything-- they're not used, but they *were* useful, so I don't want to delete them.

**Many of them don't work now.**


(`markov-generator` still works fine, though!)


If anybody wants to take on fixing them, feel free!
