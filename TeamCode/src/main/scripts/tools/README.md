This is a location for one-off tools that I made for one reason or another. They don't help compiling or anything-- they're not used, but they *were* useful, so I don't want to delete them.

**Many of them don't work now.**

- `build-visualizer` was broken by the genealogies moving to `assets`. I can't just change the file because it needs to look back through our whole git history. idk if there's a way to do that with multiple files, so I'll leave it broken for now.
- `visualise-autoauto-trees` needed to be explicitly called *by* the compiler.

(`markov-generator` still works fine, though!)


If anybody wants to take on fixing them, feel free!
